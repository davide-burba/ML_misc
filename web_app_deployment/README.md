# Web app deployement

Toy project to understand pipeline for web application based on deep learning models.

Breakdance powermove classifier. The web application is available at: https://powermove-identifier.onrender.com [not active now]

I used ResNet50 within fastai framework, following instructions given in https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=2

In this directory we develop the model used for the web app. The code used to build the app is available at https://github.com/davide-burba/powermove_classifier
